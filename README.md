## üîç Key SQL Analyses Performed

1. Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows  
2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows  
3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)  
4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix  
5. Identify the longest movie  
6. Find content added in the last 5 years  
7. Find all the movies/TV shows by director **Rajiv Chilaka**  
8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons  
9. Count the number of content items in each genre  
10. Find each year and the average number of content releases in India on Netflix. Return the **top 5 years** with the highest average.  
11. List all movies that are documentaries  
12. Find all content without a director  
13. Find how many movies actor **Salman Khan** appeared in during the last 10 years  
14. Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the most movies produced in India  
15. Categorize the content based on the presence of the keywords **"kill"** and **"violence"** in the description field.  
    - Label content containing these keywords as **"Bad"** and all other content as **"Good"**  
    - Count how many items fall into each category
