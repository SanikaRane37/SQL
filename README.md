# Netflix Dataset SQL Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the **Netflix dataset** using SQL. The goal is to gain meaningful insights into the content available on Netflix, such as distribution by type, most common ratings, trends over time, and other useful patterns.

## üîç Key SQL Analyses Performed

1. Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows
2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows
3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)
4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix
5. Identify the longest movie
6. Find content added in the last 5 years
7. Find all the movies/TV shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'!
8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons
9. Count the number of content items in each genre
10.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix. 
return top 5 year with highest avg content release!
11. List all movies that are documentaries
12. Find all content without a director

## üõ† Tools & Tech

- **SQL**: Core analysis language (tested on MySQL/PostgreSQL syntax)
- **DBMS**: Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **Data Source**: [Kaggle - Netflix Dataset]

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- SQL-compatible database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- SQL client or interface (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin)

---

## üìä Output

Most queries return:
- Clean tabular results
- Grouped and aggregated values
- Insightful breakdowns by type, year, genre, etc.

Visualizations can be built using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python notebooks after exporting query results.

## üß† Future Improvements

- Create views and stored procedures for repeatable insights
- Build a dashboard with visual charts (e.g., using Tableau or Power BI)
- Incorporate time-series analysis or machine learning on trends
